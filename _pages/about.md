I am currently working as a Research Assistant at Research Center for Information Technology Innovation, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan. I am also currently working towards a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Information Engineering at National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan. Before that, I obtained an MS degree in Computer Science and Information Engineering from National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan, and BS degree in Computer Science from Brawijaya University, Malang, Indonesia.
