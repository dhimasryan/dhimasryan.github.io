I am currently working as a Research Assistant at Research Center for Information Technology Innovation, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan. I am also currently working towards a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Information Engineering at National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan. Before that, I obtained an MS degree in Computer Science and Information Engineering from National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan, and BS degree in Computer Science from Brawijaya University, Malang, Indonesia. 

My research interests include deep learning, speech processing, and deep learning-based non-intrusive speech assessment model. Please kindly check the following <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=czoBHtoAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">link</a> for more update publication.
